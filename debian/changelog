  * Added a menu file, closes: #76973.
  * Made XMotd.ad a symlink, not a copy of XMotd.

xmotd (1.14b3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed app-defaults location, Closes: #86319
  * Since the maintainer of the package made only one release, in 1996,
    and there have been 2 NMU's since, it's orphaned. Set maintainer to
    debian-qa.
  * Converted to debhelper, since it was the quickest way to
    get it to fully comply with current policy.
