xmotd is a message-of-the-day browser for X11 and
dumb-terminals. 

WHAT'S NEW

1.17.3 fixes a timestamp bug introduced in 1.17.2. The patch was
contributed by Marcin Owsiany and also Andy Roosen (who also added
more features to xmotd; these will appear in a future version).

REQUIREMENTS

xmotd requires, a C compiler and at minimum, X11R5 including Xt (the X
Toolkit) for the resource and command-line parsing functions, and the
Athena widget (Xaw) libraries. Optionally, Xm (the Motif toolkit)
should be installed if you wish to compile the Motif version; the Xpm
library should be installed if you wish to compile-in support for
colour logos.

The HTML library is not included with the 'lite' distribution.

BUILDING

First, unpack the distribution with:

    zcat xmotd-1.17.x.tar.gz | tar xvf -

A directory called xmotd-1.17.x will be created; cd into that
directory and to build the default flavour type:

    xmkmf -a; make all

Note: If your xmkmf does not support the -a option
(e.g. /usr/openwin/bin/xmkmf), type:

   xmkmf; make makefiles; make all

xmotd can be built in different flavours:
    - with the Athena widget library (default), or;
    - with Athena & HTML widget, or;
    - with the Motif widget library, or;
    - with Motif and HTML widget.

Refer to the commentary in the Imakefile for details on customizing
the build for HTML, Motif and XPM support.

INSTALLATION

After the compilation is complete (ignore compilation warnings when
the HTML widget is being compiled) and if you wish to install xmotd
automatically, type:

    make install

NOTE: that "make install" will replace your app-defaults file (if you
have previously installed xmotd ) with the app-defaults in the
distribution. If you have modified your app-defaults, make a copy
before invoking the install.

Alternatively, you can manually copy the xmotd binary to the install
directory and the manual-page to the man8 directory.

PLATFORMS

It has been sucessfully compiled here at Ryerson under SunOS 4.1.4,
Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6 and 2.8 and GNU/Linux 2.4.18.

xmotd has also been successfully compiled on the following platforms:

    HP 9000/735 running HP-UX 9.03 (X11R5).  
    IBM RS/6000 model C10 (PowerPC) running AIX v3.2.5.
    Silicon Graphics INDY running Irix 5.3 (X11R5)
    Mips/CDC (running EPIX) and PCS/M68030 (running MUNIX/SysV). 

MANIFEST

This distribution contains the following files:

        README                  (this file)
        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS        (contributors to xmotd)
        GNU                     (Terms of GPL)
        Imakefile               (X Consortium's gift to humanity)
        Makefile                (...3 guesses)
        XMotd                   (app-defaults)
        XMotd_motif             (Motif app-defaults)
        xmotd.8                 ([nt]roff man-page)
        xlogo.bm                (default bitmap, the "X"-logo)
        xlogo.xpm               (default pixmap used w/ xpm support)
        *.c, *.h                (source)
        browser                 (shell script)
        libhtmlw/               (NCSA HTML widget; not in 'lite' version)


xmotd has many options. Refer to the man-page for further details on
customizing and more examples showing xmotd in use. You can read the
man-page, without installing it, with the following command:

    nroff -man xmotd.8 | less

APP-DEFAULTS

xmotd can be customized via editres.

Reasonably adequate application defaults are compiled into xmotd so it
is NOT necessary to install the supplied app-defaults file.

You can also customize the resources with the supplied app-defaults
file, XMotd. The Motif version is called XMotd_motif; rename it XMotd
before installing and comment-out appropriate resources if building
with HTML support. The app-defaults file installs in:

         $ProjectRoot/lib/X11/app-defaults/XMotd

All resources are available as command-line option equivalents so
xmotd may be customized completely via the command-line.
